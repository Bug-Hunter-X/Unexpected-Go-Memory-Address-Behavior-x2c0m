```Go
//There's no solution to directly compare memory addresses since that's not what memory addresses are intended for in Go.
// Go's memory management handles allocation and deallocation automatically, so we don't need to directly work with memory addresses.
// Instead, focus on the values of the variables themselves and using the proper comparison techniques for those data types.

func main() {
    var i int = 10
    var j int = 10

    fmt.Println(i == j) // Compares the values, resulting in true
    //Avoid doing something like this:
    //fmt.Println(&i == &j) //This is not meaningful because memory addresses are not stable across different variables and program runs
}
```
